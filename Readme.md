    "## Question / Hypothesis\n",
    "We aim to investigate whether multilateral climate funds are efficiently targeting the most vulnerable countries and regions. Specifically, we will analyze how financing flows vary geographically and by project types, and examine the alignment of these flows with climate vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "- Climate Funds Update Dashboard: https://climatefundsupdate.org/data-dashboard/#1541245664232-8e27b692-05c8  \n",
    "- Annual CO2 Emissions per Country (Our World in Data): https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country  \n",

    "- Climate Finance Vulnerability Index (CliF-VI - Columbia Climate School): https://ncdp.columbia.edu/microsite-page/clifvi/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planned Analysis\n",
    "We plan to perform descriptive statistics and correlation analyses to explore the relationship between climate fund allocations and vulnerability. This will include visualizing the geographic distribution of funds and comparing this with emissions and vulnerability data. Our goal is to understand which countries are contributing most to climate change and which are in most need of support.\n"
